# Support Vector Machines Project 

## Overview
A practice on using support vector machines to predicting the species of flowers based on features such as sepal length and width petal length and petal width. The data was pulled from one of seaborn's default data sets; that is,
````python
iris = sns.load_dataset('iris')
````
